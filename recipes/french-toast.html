    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside.</p>
    <p>The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
